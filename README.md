# 🔢📝 Binary Transformer

## 📌 About the Project
This project was inspired by a **middle school Computer Discoveries class** preparing for a test on **encoding and decoding text, numbers, and images using binary representation**. The goal of this tool is to **differentiate assessments** by providing an interactive, visual way for students to engage with binary encoding concepts. 

This tool **supports all students**, including those who may struggle with math or reading, by offering a **hands-on way to practice encoding and decoding information** in a clear and structured format.

## 🚀 Project Features
✅ **Clickable Binary Grid**  
- Each square represents **white (off = 0)** and **black (on = 1)**.  
- Click a square to toggle between **0 and 1**.  

✅ **Choose Data Type (Number or Text)**  
- If set to **"Number"**, the grid represents **binary doubling**, calculating a **hidden total**.  
- If set to **"Text"**, the grid follows **ASCII encoding**, converting binary into readable characters.  

✅ **Live Output Interpretation**  
- Displays the **calculated total for numbers** or **decoded ASCII character for text**.  

✅ **Reset Function**  
- Quickly **clear the grid** and start over.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. Click squares on the **8-column grid** to toggle between **black (1) and white (0)**.  
2. Select the **data type** for encoding:  
   - **"Number"** → Binary doubling system (right to left).  
   - **"Text"** → Converts binary input into **ASCII characters**.  
3. The **decoded value** appears in real time.  
4. Click **Reset** to clear the grid and start fresh.

## 🏗️ Future Improvements
🔹 Expand the grid to support **multi-character encoding**  
🔹 Add **binary image encoding** for pixel-based learning  
🔹 Implement **real-time quizzes and feedback**  

🚀 **Enjoy exploring binary encoding with the Binary Transformer!**
